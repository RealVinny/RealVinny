# Vinny  
**Autonomous Technologist | Cybersecurity, Robotics, Linux**

Driven by curiosity, grounded in practicality. I take things apart to learn how they work â€” and if I can't see inside, I'll find a way. I study Computer Science, but most of what I know comes from real-world experimentation, not classrooms.

Iâ€™m currently focused on cybersecurity, robotics, and GNU/Linux systems. To me, tech is a tool for independence â€” not something to get trapped in.
