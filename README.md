# Vinny

Learning software development by building small, functional projects.  
Most of this is practice: Java, C, CLI tools, and database interaction.

## Projects

### 🐾 [Zoologico](https://github.com/RealVinny/Zoologico)  
A simple zoo simulation in Java, focused on OOP basics like inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.

### 🎉 [listaAniversario](https://github.com/RealVinny/listaAniversario)  
Application that uses a given database to work with in Java.

### 🛒 [listaDeCompras](https://github.com/RealVinny/listaDeCompras)  
Basic shopping list with CLI interface.

### 💻 [JavaProject](https://github.com/RealVinny/PasswordGenerator)  
A simple password generator coded in Java.

### 🗄️ [databaseComJava](https://github.com/RealVinny/databaseComJava)  
Java + JDBC to interact with a relational database. Reads, writes and updates records.

I’m still exploring and breaking things on purpose.  
Most code here is for learning, not production.
